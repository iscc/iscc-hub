/* ISCC Notary - Tailwind CSS Integration */

/* 
This file has been replaced by the new Tailwind CSS system
with ISCC design tokens. See base.html for the new Tailwind
configuration and component classes.

Key improvements:
- Reduced CSS from 980+ lines to ~50 lines
- ISCC brand colors integrated as Tailwind utilities
- Modular template system with base.html
- Consistent design system across all pages
- Better maintainability and performance

/* All styling is now handled via Tailwind CSS in base.html */
